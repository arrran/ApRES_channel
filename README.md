# ApRES_channel
Using ApRES to look at subglacial mass balance in a sub-ice-shelf channel on the Siple Coast, Antarctica
Looking at ApRES time series obtained at the apex of the channel.  Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave Radar techniques are used to process data to obtain basal displacement and strain.  Next, amplitude tracking techniques are used to analyse the data-set in greater detail to better constrain basal processes. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the time series, including the properties of the basal environment, its change, and the processes driving the change.
